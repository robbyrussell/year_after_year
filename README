YearAfterYear
==============

This plugin allows you to keep your copyright year up-to-date.

Example
=======

You can render the current year in your ERb views like so:

  <%= current_year -%>

If you want to provide a year range, you can use year_range and provide the
year that you started.

  Example: With the assumption that the current year was 2008

  <%= year_range(2005) -%>     # => 2005-2008
  <%= year_range(2008) -%>     # => 2008 (just returns current year)
